# Inner Conflict with American Dream 

Who's a good parent ? One who is always involved or one who makes you extremely independent. The ideological question applies to the country you live in my head.
India on one hand is like the parent who wants to decide what you should or should not do. America allows more freedom, more mistakes. 

An involved parent might smother the kid by not letting them mistakes,  but the independent parent might not be there for you when you are in need 
for help and direction. India with its multiple and enforced set of festivals, norms, extremely involved social circles makes life  easier as you're not alone and many decisions are just made for you. 
America with its unlimited availability of choice, allows for friendships where society is together because they like each other for 
certain co-dependent activities. 

**The American Dream is very desirable , but is it worth it ? **

What do you choose ? Being around family/friends doing group thing or choosing activities that serve your inherent inner desires.  
Finding activities that stimulate others or doing things that are self satisfying. 

For most people, there is a spectrum.  After many years of living independently, my realization is that the desire for materializing
your inner desires is what excites you, but doing the things where you make someone have a good time is what makes you fulfilled.
