# Just Living By

What's the fascination about living in someone else's shoes? Doing their jobs, hanging around in their social circle, living in their bodies. 
There's a comedy movie about each of these.
Why does the idea of a vacation thrill us so much ? You look forward to it for the coming weeks. Finding yourself through travel is a big sell for youngsters.
How can a new hobby/friend/location can change you entirely in a few months ? There seems to be a new viral dance move or coffee making trend all the time.

The contrast is the fact that many of us are doing the same everyday. Eating the same breakfast, doing the same job for years, having the same
friends, living in the same place, eating similar meal, watching the same content. 

In this world where new experiences are both easy to get and plenty of variety available, the balance between easy to do regulars versus the unknown new which comes with multiple hidden obstacles is seen on a daily basis and the regular wins almost everytime. 

Order from the same resteraunt on doordash or find a new one after reading reviews when hunger was at its peak. 
Find a new movie on netflix or watch the same old show or just the top recommendation
Find a new gift or gift a giftcard.

I was watching the new HBO movie, "Fake Famous" and realized that the instagram celebrities instead of giving the same content to their audiences push through to 
find new experiences to share. One of the big reasons for them being celebrities is how they are so dynamic. 

So instead of just living by, just doing the basic minimum and then looking forward to that vacation or wanting to change yourself or becoming like the influencer you follow, stop half-assing through life. 
Take a path with hidden risks and unknowns instead of the same route you always take. Maybe this is what people mean, when they say live life to the fullest.
