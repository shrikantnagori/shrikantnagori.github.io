# Just Living By

What's the fascination about living in someone else's shoes? Doing their jobs, hanging around in their social circle, living in their bodies. 
There's a comedy movie about each of these.
Why does the idea of a vacation thrill us so much ? You look forward to it for the coming weeks. Finding yourself through travel is a big sell for youngsters.
How can a new hobby/friend/location can change you entirely in a few months ? There seems to be a new viral dance move or coffee making trend every couple months

The contrast is the fact that many of us are doing the same everyday. Eating the same breakfast, doing the same job for years, having the same
friends, living in the same place, eating similar meal, watching the same content. 

In this world where new experiences are both easy to get and plenty of variety available, the balance between easy to do regulars versus the unknown new which comes with multiple hidden obstacles is seen on a daily basis and the regular wins almost everytime. 

Order from the same resteraunt on doordash or fine a new one and read reviews especially when you had searched for food, when hunger was at its peak. 
Find a new movie on netflix or watch the same old show or top recommendation
Find a new gift or gift a giftcard.

Instead of just living by, just doing the basic minimum and then looking forward to that vacation or wanting to change yourself, stop half-assing through life. 
Take a path with hidden risks and unknowns instead of the same route you always take. Maybe this is what people mean, when they say live life to the fullest.
