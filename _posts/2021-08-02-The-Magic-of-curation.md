# The magic of curation 

Internet is amazing. Writers like me everyday are producing content. There is no problem of supply or demand. There is a huge confusion though on what 
to consume. What is good ? This is the problem curators are solving. Curation is the way a number of individuals are making the internet a better place.


Examples like [How to live](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/14/manual-for-civilization-reading-list/) and [fun internet links](https://perell.com/recommendations/) are 
some of the more followed ones. 

The above curations are the equivalent of "Shabri ke Ber". Once you have identified a few such ber pickers, you stop eating sour fruits. Curation is a lot like
gardening, you decide what type of flowers you want in your garden, you water them, you watch them grow and provide comfort to all those who see it. Curating links 
on internet provides the same, anyone going through the list of books you rated highly, articles you recommended, videos that changed you get a chance to find the new adventures in store
for them.

Ask yourself when was the last time you shared meaningful links to friends, not a meme, not a trending news topic , not a movie song. If it sounds like far long ago,
it might be time to think how you are per-using the internet and would leveraging these curators provide a better experience than the one you are having with your
current push based feed.

Among all the curations, my favorite place for finding curations is github. Its a open source repository, anyone can copy and edit , so a curated list gets curated by 
hundreds of interested individuals and not just one. 

Some of the ones i have leveraged in my past

[System Design Primer](https://github.com/madd86/awesome-system-design)

[Curated list about curated lists](https://github.com/eyalev/awesome-reading-lists)

i would love to build tools to make curated content more accessible as I do believe its a much better way of internet consumption.
