# On practical internet usage 

The internet has become a recommendation heavy product. We are all connected to the internet 100% of our non sleeping lives. But what we get out of the internet 
leaves much to be desired. Businesses / Push notifications / Feed like products will push you data they want you to consume and not what you wanted to know about.

Divide the internet usage into two categories. Passive internet and Active internet usage. The more you reduce your passive internet usage and increase your active 
internet usage, the more the rewards that are available. 

I am not denying there are certain viral trends and new movie releases that are good to know about via push based delivery. Passive internet usage by just opening 
a app on your phone is undeniably a good reward after spending 4 hours in school or 8 hours at work. This is what we tell our brain and allow the bad behavior to 
further continue. 

Based on this, one very simple idea for a nice product is this

**As you open a app, it asks you a few simple questions**

1\ What are you going to do on the app ? Is this passive/active internet consumption.

2\ If this is passive consumption, how long do you want to be passively titulated ? 

3\ If this is an active consumption, what topics do you want to focus on ? How long do you think you can maintain focus on this topic.

4\ When you switch apps, it asks , did you do what you wanted or not or validates by itself.

Thinking in advance about what you want from the internet is hard and requires building up a curiosity muscle in the long run. Humans are nothing but creatures of 
habit. Even if we don't force ourselves through this exercise every time, doing it on weekends or starting with a few days of the week can be really good practice.
