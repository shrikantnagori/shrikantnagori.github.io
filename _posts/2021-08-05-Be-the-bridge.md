# Be the Bridge

Have you asked yourself what quality you want in a friend/family/colleague ? Validation, care, comfort, passion, competition, curiosity, the list goes on... 
What we want from others is basically what we want in our life and we want the vacant space in our life to be filled by the presence of that individual.

Individuals need someone to help get from their reality to their dreams . Being a good person is about being that bridge upon which others can take a step 
to get from reality to dreams. One doesn't have to walk the path with their friend, nor do they have to provide the full path. Sometimes the individual is already
on the path from reality to dreams and the friend just needs to be around in their journey. Sometimes, you can show light which makes the path more visible or
somedays its about pointing out the rock on the other side and get them back to reality.

Being the bridge in others journeys is what helps you to understand what looked like a long journey starts with that belief and trust. Being the bridge is where the
biggest learning for yourself is, because no where is more inspiring than being around people who are taking new challenges and finding comfort that you are there
with them for the ride.
