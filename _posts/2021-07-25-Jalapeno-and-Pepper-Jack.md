# Jalapeno and Pepper Jack


Jalapeno was listening to the hum of the wind-chime, She was trying to eat the small bug, but the wind-chime was disturbing him. She tried to find the root-cause of 
the ruckus. The sound was coming from the bell hung below the tree. A family of squirrels were trying to get to the peach, which was causing the wind-chime to 
make sounds.

Jalapeno took a look at the family, mom and dad were at the couch , she made a sound, informing them that she was going to solve the problem as usual. She lept to the
direction of the tree. Her plan was to scare the squirrels away. She started barking, the squirrels didnt budge and were going at the peach tree and wind-chime kept
ringing. Jalapeno realized she needed to scare more. She decided to go close. She jumped up the tree, it was surprisingly easy, she was walking carefully to flash 
a claw at the squirrel.

Suddenly she was nearing the squirrel, the squirrel realizing there was nowhere to be safe jumped to a different branch. Chasing Jalapeno fell down on the grass.
She found herself in someone else's yard.
