# Disaster Recovery In Life

It all starts with a single mis-step. Forgetting to call a friend back, next thing they called you in middle of the night. Since there was a cricket final going on ,
our protagonist stayed up all night. Next morning, he missed the leads meeting, so to impress the team stayed late and didn't come home till 9 missing out dinner with the wife. 
A series of unfortunate events continued and led to our protagonist getting depressed and sad , had a major falling out with his collegues and family, 
and went out drinking 4 nights in a row.

Everyone has a routine and it gets disrupted from time to time, being attached to a routine is itself somewhat questionable, but it helps. Breakages in routines in life 
is like a disaster recovery event for systems and the question always is: When a DR event occurs, do systems come back up or do they need manual help ? 

Unlike systems where a lot of people care about them getting back up after a disaster, since only you are in charge of fixing it, its easy to avoid fixing the 
root cause/bug by adding patches , distract yourself from the real problems and just delay the fix. I call it the things look okay, but issues can cause systems to 
break to anytime phase. These distractions are not always bad, but sometimes you fall into your old patterns, for some it might be smoking , for some, just
getting in their shell etc.

Routines are so embedded, that we forget why we have them. They are not written down anywhere, its something that happens organically. So , when they are disturbed,
its important to re-call the value they add, the distractions they help avoid. Each disaster is considered important because it helps you re-think what matters and
what doesnt. See how you can find the value in these events instead of being worried that your perfect plan got interrupted !
