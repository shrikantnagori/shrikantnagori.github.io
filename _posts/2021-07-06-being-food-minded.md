# Being food minded 

I care about food. Not in the manner of what I'm eating contains the right nutrients, more in the sense of I need my calories on time. Missing 
out on calories, my mind, my body and the entire behavior combines to make me act like an animal. I am happy to spend time discussing what
to eat , what possible options exists and bring out the hidden leadership qualities to get to the consensus need for me to get to my next set of 
calories by debating the pros/cons and realities of the situation. I get even surly , partly unintentionally, to guilt people into it.

We are like pets in this regard. Food and appreciation are large motivators, The adage comes to mind, 
"Acche khaane ke liye to kabhi bhi kahi bhi aa jayenge hum" . Translates to "We can go anywhere, anytime for good food".  Food remains one of the biggest
social topics and to a large extent a big part of our lives and social activities. Finding a new eatery is like finding that next investment which one hopes
pays out for the next few years. 
 
Given the amount of time food takes in our lives, should we treat it as an addiction ? Not so ! Learning to cook one's own meals, fasting, changing diets , 
leaving some items and picking up something new should be couple of tenets to live by in this food minded world to gain some control to stop being animalistic.
