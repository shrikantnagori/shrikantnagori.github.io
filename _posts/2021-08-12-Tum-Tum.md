# Tum Tum

Humans travel. Of all the transport modes that I have taken, my favorite is the tum-tum. Tum-tum was the small red mini bus that ran inside the IIT-B Campus. 

Travel is divided into few categories. Daily travel and vacation travel. Airplanes/trains fall into the latter category these days and cars/bikes/buses fall into
the first. As someone, who has driven cars in the last 7 years primarily, I have a huge fondness of public transport and absolutely love working from NY just because
I get to travel via subway to the office daily. Watching the other humans going through the motion early in the morning, that look in the evening after a tired day,
thinking about food is what I absolutely love about the public transport . It makes me feel a little closer to other humans on this planet.

I have taken mini-buses to school every single day when i was young. It used to cost 2 bucks to my school and I absolutely loved the adventure it was . Finding 
a bus, negotiating the price, using the saved money on drinks outside school. 

Why i like tum-tum the most I cant figure out, maybe it was because college was a special time, 20 friends used to  wait and catch 
the same bus, maybe because instead of riding, we used to hang from a ledge, maybe because tum tum was just a convenience and not a necessity as one could easily
walk the distance. 

One thing is for sure, like tum-tum, for anything to become nostalgic, it needs a social element, a adventure element and a comfort element. When you find these 
three, to steal a quote my favorite show, know that "you're currently living the good old days" :)
