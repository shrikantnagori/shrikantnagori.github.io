# Anchoring Bias 

I've heard a lot about anchoring bias. Why Tendulkar and Ganguli are so fondly remembered, why Cricket always have a special place in our heart, why OG will be 
my favorite DOTA team. Whoever was defining the genre, when you got into it, remains the one you anchor new experiences by. 

My eighty year old neighbour contrasts the resteraunts they go now to the ones they used to go when they were newly married. The places which were considered 
landmarks back then dont even show up in Google searches, yet the fondness remains. 

We still watch the top bollywood and hollywood actors long after they are past their prime. I continue to listen to Kishore Kumar, A R Rahman or Arijit Singh 
many months after the kind of music they did is now considered not hip. 

The question remains , what helps us remove the bias ? It's almost impossible to remove the bias for everything. Not everything in your life continues past 
the first many months you were deeply passionate about. When was the last time , a lot of us watched a F1 Race. 

The goal should therefore be to find passions that last across years and layering them with with nuances both past and present e.g. music, movies, food and friends, 
instead of treating them to anchoring bias. I think relationships are one of the most  interesting part of this. 
Every new company you join, new team you work with, new friends that you meet,  family members you get close to, it's important to remove the bias and 
embrace the new experience in your journey.
