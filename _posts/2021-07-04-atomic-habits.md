# Atomic Habits

Having finished the book, I wanted to run that exercise that the author asked the readers to do. 

So, i am trying to ask myself the question. What new habits I want to cultivate and what new identity I want to associate with myself.

*Learning by failing and examining*
  - This is the most generic soundbite ever, but the standard approach I have to things outside the daily requirement is to give enough time, and over time,
 I'll get better. While this is true, the yearning it takes to self-examine, understand self weaknesses, asking for help is where I have a long way to go. 
 This is where hoping that the written word journey will come a long way. 

*Compassion can be unlimited, do more than you thought possible*
  - As COVID happened around us, the little we did for family, the more rewarding it was. With the rest of the world, suffering , we kept ourselves busy and avoided
the distractions 

That's all the time for today. Thanks for engaging !
