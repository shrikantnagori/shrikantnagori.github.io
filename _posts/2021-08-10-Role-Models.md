# Role Models

Who is a role model to you ? This is often asked when you are young and people stop asking you as you age. This is similar to the question of
what do you want to be when you grow up ? The reason the question stops being relevant is because life was abstract when we were young and it becomes concrete
as we age. We have to live with the decisions we have taken. If you are an engineer, you cannot have a politician as a role model. If you are working for 
government, Mukesh Ambani cannot be your role model. 

The point of this post is to ask to have role models outside of the scope of one's career. A person should have a role model for their family goals, role model 
for social interactions, role model for fitness, role model for philanthropy. Not only having interests outside of work help shape a person, the role models
simplify the world view for them which they cannot build by themselves in that field. 

The role models exist for inspiration and not competition, they are supposed to provide you the motivation to continue iterating, not self reflect into doubt about
your progress. So think about role models and list them as they are the ones whose ideals you are following in your life even though you think they are uniquely 
yours.
