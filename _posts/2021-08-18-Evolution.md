# Enjoy the nature, will you ? 

Can you predict when 2030 hits, what will be listed as the top milestones of the decade ? Can you list what are the biggest inventions , advances of humanity of 
2010-2020 ? I'd say the biggest advances come from the companies whose shares grew 10x in the past decade, the ones who are now at billon
dollar valuations like say tesla model x, amazon kindle and 2 day shopping, google nest/thermostats, instagram/oculus vr, crypto-currencies like ethereum/bitcon
with potential to replace fiat money, AI innovations like beating alpha go, GPT-3, MRNA vaccines.

What will be the advances of this century ? Flying cars,  Social bonding in VR seem like obvious next steps. What about reliving part of your life via VR and
advances in storage and AI, aka black mirror. Bots powered by AI designing animation, writing books, this could be a decade of amazing creativity. 
What about adoption though ?

With technology evolving at the pace it is, do we expect world will evolve and move at the pace of advancement in tech ? I still dont know
all the flags, features, integration my devices have.  But as brand building is becoming the biggest currency in the world and it can only happen by knowing
the latest  tech, the world has to evolve to learn the new tech if it wants to make money. 

Humans have inherent basic motivations. The seven deadly sins. I'd say this was a decade where pride, envy, gluttony and sloth products were well rewarded as humans
got to know about more humans as their social circles grew via the internet. Lust was probably a good industry too. What I believe will define the next decade are
products that help manipulate human emotions, being able to make yourself happy via a life coach or a video game in VR. As we run into problems of plenty in every 
thing, nature around us is getting limited and will become a luxury . Humans will soon pay a huge premium to enjoy the little left of it to satisfy their prides. 
So, go do the nature bucket list, because it wont be around forever !
