# Musings

- Title of the note and the top two lines matter more than the next 20 lines, if you are able to use a phrase or keyword that people recognize, you're in 
 and you have their attention.
 
- Develop your own style. Find your voice. Its okay to copy others to find your voice, overtime you do develop your own observations. 

- Learning to learn and setting goals for yourself in new spaces are key to grow in life. 

- People who used to chase trends were  marked as fools since trends become common lore in 5-10 years. With the recent investment in tech, trends become real within
 2-3 years. Whether it be crypto-currencies , NFT, virtual reality, maybe even flying cars, I expect the trends to become common-place sooner than before. Betting on trends
 in 2020-2030s is probably the early signal that 2020 gave. Early trend chasers are not dreamers, but just investors at this point.
 
 - Being in america in 2020-21 has really both hurt and been good. Not being able to travel back to India has been the worst, distance does make a difference. On the
  other hand , it has provided a shelter from the virus and shielded what worse was happening in the rest of the world. America with its wealth is an illusion that 
  life is good.
