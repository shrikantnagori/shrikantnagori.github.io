# The religious traveller

I have travelled a lot with my parents to places all across India. The travels were family affair, involved more than just our family and primarily involved
visiting religious places in different parts of the country. Whether it be the "Chaar Dhaam" or the "12 Jyotirlinga ( Shiva Temples) ", the travel bucket list was
less about adventurous travel, but more about the scripture suggested list. Following the list will get you into heaven is the big promise, that people chase.

Religious travel is one of the more economic status friendly travel as it supports poor and rich alike. The rich can get ahead in lines with their big donations, 
and continue to feel superior, whereas the poor is there for the god to save from multitude of trouble befallen upon them. The middle class is just happy they have a 
good thing going on, seeing the swarm of others. Everyone gets what they want.

As the generation is evolving, religious travel is still making money from the volume, but not from the middle and upper class. The new generation doesn't 
get to post tiktok/instagram travel vlogs , the rise of internet has also made concept of religion uglier. Can religious travel survive ? I am sure, it will.
Religion doesnt just go away. Its imbibed in us from a young age and so we eventually get back to it, like patriarchy. 

What religious travel needs is a fresh perspective for the current generation. Its not about creating hashtags on janmashtami or hanuman jayanti. 
Building products for teens that are religion inspired like Krishna comics or other cartoons, building games ( board games , escape rooms) leveraging the rich backstory of these
places and individuals. Building better live streaming/internet solutions for individuals to stay better connected to teachings ( think substack/podcasts) and providing
airbnb experiences for the traveller is the big space I expect multiple business to venture in the next coming years.
