# Breadth or depth

In this current age of information, breadth of knowledge is the norm. From whatsapp forwards to reddit memes, people keep talking about 100s or thousands of amazing
things that is going on in the world. Most people dont bother double clicking/ tapping into the data, but take the factoid either false/true at face value. 

As there is a constant distraction available, being able to focus and dive deep or go depth wise into a topic is as unlikely as ever. People still do rabbit holing , much
less on wikipedia, much more on youtube, albeit more passively there. Breadth wise learner feels like they can explain everything in the world, lack of depth wise
learning makes the world less passionate.

Knowing what to double click on and what to ignore is an under-sold skill in these times. Google and other giants will keep feeding more and more data to you, what 
you consume and what you exercise is upto you. Application based learning retains much more than theoritical learning. Since in the end retention is all that matters,
might as well, play the long game and pick depth-wise over breadth-wise whenever you can.
