# Debating: Futile or Fertile 

Resolving arguments is one of the only things humans has over the rest of the animal kingdom. Animals most often resort to threat of violence and violence itself

People say the best way to debate someone is to see yourself in their shoes, its not always easy, you dont know their background, their struggles and how they have been 
shaped. The best you can do is to trace the reasoning that led them to a decision they are at, to see if given the information they
had,  will you have the same conclusion or not !
