# On SSDs

   This is not really a perspective as much as it is hopefully a simpler explanation of what properties of SSD's are important as consumers/developers. Most of us
   will not need to know this, and there's wikipedia for those who want to dive deep into it. This is what my summarization of important SSD features are.

## RAIDs 
- A SSD comes with different configurations RAID0/RAID1 etc. RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disk.  
- RAIDs allow user to store files in different drives to get better performance.

- RAID0 implies that there is no redundancy. Just being able to read files faster
- RAID1 implies that disk 2 is just mirring disk1. So if one disk is destoyed , other disk is still available.

## Host interface
This is the connector that connects the controller to the storage and therefore has limited bandwidth.

- Serial ATA and mSATA variant  6.0 Gbit/s : Built primarily for HDD
- PCI Express CIe 3.0 Ã—4, 31.5 Gbit/s : THe new standard , this comes with a new software protocol called nvme


## NAND Flash Type
A flash storage chip has non-volatile floating-gate memory cells. Depending on how many bits are stored per cell, we have different types of cells. 
Cheap and unreliable storage save 5 or 4 bits per cell (like PLC or QLC), whereas expensive and reliable flash is SLC ( single level cell)

- The latest tech is called V-NAND or vertical NAND , this is a way to store more electrons using a new technique called CTF and provides 10x more storage cheaper than 
SLC

## Endurance
SSD manufacturers believe that since electrons on frequent charge and discharge will behave erratically , if you want to maintain the reliability of the object for 
longer, you should not write to a disk more than certain number of times per day ( DPWD or disk writes per day) . 

Overall, these are the top aspects I think are to know about SSD. Most likely it doesnt matter to the most
