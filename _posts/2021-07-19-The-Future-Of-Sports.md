# Being competitive

As the famous dialogue in the 3 idiots movie, " Life is a race ", being competitive comes naturally to us. Evolution has told us, its the survival of the fittest. 
From the youngest ages, where scoring good marks didn't matter if you didnt score the highest to adulthood where relative grading in college and relative ranking 
in workplace has become a cornerstone in how we operate.
One's sense of self is determined not by how they are measuring up against their old version, but by how much progress others have made.

Being competiive has high returns , it allows you to have benchmarks that you thought were not possible. The gap lies in the fact that we never acknowledge that those were not 
the benchmarks one wanted in the first place. 
Being competitive keeps us motivated, it so easy to pick up an solo activity and leave it. With competition, you can see the
gap between you and the others increasing but you still continue to put in the time, just to keep yourself in the race.
Being competitive is fun, in most games, you compete, you're either leading or wanting to get ahead. THe fun doesnt stop. 
Being competitive helps others, like friendship, competition is a two way street, the positive and the negative affect both. So being competitive helps others as much
as it helps you.
