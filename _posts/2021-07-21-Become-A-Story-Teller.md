# Become a story-teller

I have become a much more regular reader than ever before. Call it covid, call it routine, book reading is what i do when i do chores at home. Somedays, I actually look 
forward to folding clothes, evening exercies, cooking food, grocery shopping, cleaning cob-webs as I get to spend time living someone else's life by listening to my audiobook. 

There are just plenty of genres that I have the pleasure of trying. From fiction, sci-fi , thrillers, short stories,  historical fiction, history, economics, philosophy to whatever Naseem Taleb is.
One of the main lessons has been each genre is pretty engrossing in its own way, Sometimes its central premise of the book,  sometimes its the dialogues between the characters or just 
the characters themselves, but most often than not, its the way the story is told and how good a story-teller the author is. 

What's a good story-teller ? 

A good story-teller keeps the listener engaged, they don't talk about topical news, like how's the weather or what's for dinner ? 
A good story-teller tells tales of human behaviors, foolishness, randomness, bravery, mistakes, lessons. They tell these stories because they were 
amazed by what happened, with each re-telling adding nuance to it, rather than subtracting the fun by repeating the same lines. 
A good story-teller understand that the world needs stories because the world is full of amazement . 
Just because everything is available on the internet does not mean, everyone has heard these stories, rather internet will show only a 10 s tiktok version of it, 
leaving all the nuance behind.

I will continue to read and listen and collect stories and hope to one day provide some.
