# Throw in an open area

Have you played team sport like hockey, football or frisbee ? Every player is being defended by an opposition player, so its hard to find the right person
to pass to. The key concept is to throw the ball not to a player, but in a open area where you expect the player to be after you had thrown. The trust and insight
needed to do this well is what makes an individual shine. Someone who is having a great day , you should pass the ball to them often , but not to the extent that 
if someone is free and will make a easy pass is neglected. 

In our lives, if you are managing a team , one key concept that is often missed by leaders is the above, we tend to give projects to people based on their current 
abilities, not to the idea that if we share the work in an open way, the individual will reach that level and be able to handle it. This is the kind of trust that 
is needed to make the team shine. 

The other key question in team sports is about trusting a new person. If you only trust to pass the ones who is familiar with the intricacies, you are not making 
the new person feel like a part of the team. The goal is to win, but not by using the same strategy every time. You need to develop new strategies, new individuals
to handle new challenges. Be the playmaker that involves others, find individuals strengths and throw in open areas trusting the frisbee to be handled.
