# Trivia Love

Trivia is about being passionate about the world from a knowledge point of view. Loving trivia is universal, playing whatsapp quizzes, watching jeopardy 
on netflix to playing local bar trivia games , most of us end up spending time quizzing . 

There are some obvious reasons to love trivia. As intellectuals, we all want to be able to make sense of the world around us. As quizzers, you synthesize better 
mental models to understand the flow of knowledge and recollect it more often. Being able to draw upon past information without googling is critical to maintain and
reason about complex systems. For some,  learning the histories and the stories around us is just fascinating in itself.


I enjoy how people become good at trivia. There are bad trivia and good trivia. A good trivia allows you to combine hints in question. Like how doctors do 
differential diagnosis to remove the possible illnesses, good quizzers find the right answer by eliminating the wrong answers via multiple hints laid out
in the question itself. Improving vernancular is another common
way of improving on trivia. By knowing more words that represent similar thing, you increase your chances of being able to find the potential answers. Like with
anything else, find others with the same interest and learn from them. Find the topics that repeat the most and study them in more depth like world wars, books,
sports.

One common complaint about quizzing is sometimes rote learning, remembering the dates, names of kings etc. Yeah, you will not earn enough money to spend time
learning about these facts. The key is to think of names/dates and similar facts as stories and major events in these stories. The stories play out not just on a single
day , but have a beginning and have an end all of which makes the event something affecting thousands if not millions of humans. Remembering them is knowing 
why we exist. Trivia is what makes our society what it is. If my words didnt help, hopefully [Jamie Holzhauzer's](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/722198188/episode-912-how-uncle-jamie-broke-jeopardy) amazing story may inspire you.
