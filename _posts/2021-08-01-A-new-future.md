# A new internet approaches

People like imaginary worlds. The number of people who played Pokemon Go, the fan base around Harry Potter and Game of Thrones are testament to the power of stories
and fictional world. It might have sounded like a plot of a sci-fi book a few decades ago, but humans are already living 100% connected to internet and are able to 
communicate and experience shared events with billions around the world as they occur.

Metaverse is taking the idea to the next level. Most of our adventures are in real world, like hiking/ cliff jumping / swimming . Experiences in the internet are 
interesting, but evolving. Vr headsets have made humans like characters in video games. You can now perform heroic feats, have solo experiences and or even shared 
ones ranging from real life actions like play table tennis to totally imaginary adventures like quidditch while flying. 

It's obvious that metaverse will consume more and more of our focus , the number of people who smoke up or drink to escape the mundane is large enough to tell you
the world wants to live in interesting environments independent of whether they are social or anti-social. 

As metaverse evolves, one aspect I am most excited by is being able to live multiple lives at once and the impact of that to the human psyche as new tech meets 
years of evolution . One of the core features of metaverse will be to checkout any version of your life, one in which you are a professional athlete, one in which 
you run a famous company, one in which you are a person from another gender. 

Will the ability to experience different lives allow the world to have more empathy or less towards others ? Will people even compare their metaverse self with others ?
Will we have economy in the metaverse ? Will bots be allowed that are allowed to spread propogandas even more. I truly believe i will know these answers in my 
lifetime and expect some amazing neuro-plasticity wins for humans.
