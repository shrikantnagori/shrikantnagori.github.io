# Self Honesty

We tell stories to ourselves on a daily basis. However, most of the stories have certain lies. Its the easiest to lie to oneself. 
If I am saying something to myself, it must be true. Why would I lie to myself ? Some common lies we tell ourselves. 

- Q : How long will it take to finish this project ?
- A: One week. 

- Q: What can i achieve today ?
- A:  These 4 things.

- Q: What new goals I will be able to keep up with ?
- A: Sure, i can take up this new work with my previous existing work. 

- Q: Why am I not able to achieve my goals ?
- A: I am on the right path, just missing on luck. 

Lying to oneself is an everyday activity. Even setting goals is often a lie too. If I achieve these goals , I will be more happy in life  , people will love and respect me more. I will value my self-worth more.   

So , how do we break the cycle of lying to oneself ?  Most lies are hindsight and/or our brains not being evolved enough to understand complex relationships between different stories we tell ourselves.Everyone judges themselves with some 2-3 stories at any given time.  I want to be fit , I want to be a good friend , I want to be the best at work, I want to learn new things.  These different stories have different goals and managing them will imply something or the other ends up not happening and we fail at being honest to ourselves.  So , maybe let's flip the question. Instead of not lying to oneself, how can we be more honest ? 

So make choices that have trade-offs, but make it explicit that I am choosing X over Y right now . Once you say it out loud or write it down,
you end up making a conscious decision in face of trade-offs and feel more honest with yourself than ever. 

The other important aspect is definition of self. As I mentioned above, a person judges them by 2-3 goals they have for themselves for say 6 months.
If you end up failing at most stuff but those 2-3 things , its probably still the right trade-off.

The other aspect is to hedge for failure. If your goals don't allow failures, you are not setting the right goals for yourself. 
Aim and practice for the gold, if you are okay with settling for bronze. If you are practicing for bronze, you may not even make the heat.
So, stop lying to yourself and  find the gaps. Ask for coaching, practice daily , and maybe you can still be in the race if you're lucky. 
And if you lose, run again. Hopefully you'll be faster than what you were earlier.
