# Happy Birthday Papa 

Trying to recount what are my top memories

1\ Birthday celebrations

We used to throw big parties on papa's birthdays. A lot of family and some of his hospital colleagues used to get invited to a big hurrah . 
Daal baati churma at one of the picnic spots in the city. Gwalior is a drought facing city, but it always used to rain on 22nd July. 
After moving to Bombay, the session used to start on 22nd with rains and it always put a smile to my face. 
I still remember the Gupteshwar temple picnics and the steps from there to the hill-side , these places were paradise to play for young kids. 


2\ Haridwar Vacations

Hard to call it a papa memory, as much as its a family memory. I absolutely can't remember if I had as much fun anywhere in a day as much as I used to have during haridwar vacations. Just everyone in the family having a blast.
From the hillside treks to the temple early in the morning to amazing toasted bread and bournvita. 
Follow that with a long cold river bath in Ganga with thousands of others, the feeling can really make anyone spiritual.  Playing cards till lunch. From a 30 
item lunch menu to falling asleep in a food coma, only to wake up to some delicious fruits and taking a plunge in the ganga again watching the sunset. 
Finishing the nigh with amazing chaat, lassi and cards, vacations cannot get better. I think this is what has instilled in me the lifelong love for water and hikes. 


3\ The Giving Life

This one actually starts with my grand-father instead of papa. Dadi used to iterate stories about dadaji being a little naive. Independent of however much he had, 
he will provide for others in their time of need. Does someone want a drum of rice during a wedding, why not take it from his house. Someone needs kesar, he has it. 
I never met him, but my imagination of my grand-dad is that he is like my dad.

I think my mom and dad come from a different generation where life was about giving more to others rather than taking .  They came from such backgrounds ,
and achieved things in life so late that they couldnt learn how to enjoy them. Getting rich was easy, feeling rich was not. I dont think they can change, so i wish
for them to be find more ways of giving more to the world in their retirements :) 

Happy Birthday papa !
