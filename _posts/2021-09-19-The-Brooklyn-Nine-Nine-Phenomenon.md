# The Brooklyn Nine Nine Phenomenon 

The show ended this week after an amazing 8 year run. The show is one of the only ones I have followed along its 8 year arc outside of binging things in college .

1\ **The Office successor**: Even though nothing exciting happens in a paper office  whereas a detective workplace comedy is way more interesting, the show-makers spent the most time on the interpersonal relationships
than the mystery in the episode just like the office.

2\ Didn't need a few seasons to get hooked in unlike most shows as the characters well super-likable.

3\ Show's immense popularity got it back on air , even though Fox didnt renew it after season 5


The show developed themes that it ran multiple seasons, a heist episode , a detective-criminal working together episode, 
a jimmy jabs / bet based episode, a road-trip episode. A lot of tv shows have done so in the past, a halloween and christmas episode 
in friends for e.g, but B99 modifications were the season highlights, unlike adding story breakage in most other shows. 
Characters kept doubling down on their personalities, but didnt feel like they overshadowed each other. 

The finale was an amazing commentary on the show itself, especially the backstreet boys sing-along in a police roundup was a tribute to how its super hard to hit the high points in life and in show making. 
The show leaves a lot to be remembered, what i'd remember it for is the constant smile and happiness it brought me, 
how cool cool...  cool was one of the first things i said to my now wife, how Boyle redefined what it means to be a bro , it is to be a constant cheerleader,
how respect and playfulness go well together in a workplace and above all how Michael Schur is a legend.
