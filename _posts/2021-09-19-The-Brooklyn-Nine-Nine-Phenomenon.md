# The Brooklyn Nine Nine Phenomenon 

The show ended this week after an amazing 8 year fan-popular run. The show is one of the only ones I have followed along its 8 year arc outside of binging things in college . The show was an office successor as it was from the same writers and was about workplace banter for most of its run. Show's immense popularity got it back on air , even though Fox didnt renew it after season 5 . 

There are 2 aspects of the final season, that I really think stood out

1\ **Peaking and Trying**
 - The show peaked in/around season 5 , the iconic backstreet boys sing-along in a police roundup to identify the killer remains one of the best cold-opens in tv 
 history. The finale had a commentary on the fact that they kept re-trying the sing along to poor results showing how people and shows peak and then keep trying to hit the high points.  People keep remaking the iconic songs in the hope that remixes will bring them the glory due to the nostalgia. 
 
 
2\ **Using popularity for activism**
- One of the most interesting phenomenon of the last season was the commentary on police reform post BLM movement last year, a show in its twilight using its popularity to do activism is an unknown in tv lore. Bill Gates in his twilight post Microsoft moved to philanthropy, di-caprio became instrumental in environmental protecton, however leveraging not money, nor fame, but the platform that made them famous to do activism is definitely one of the big stepping stones that B99 took. 

The show leaves a lot to be remembered, what i'd remember it for is the constant smile and happiness it brought me, 
how cool cool...  cool was one of the first things i said to my now wife, how Boyle redefined what it means to be a bro , it is to be a constant cheerleader,
how respect and playfulness go well together in a workplace.
