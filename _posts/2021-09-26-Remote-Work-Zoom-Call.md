# The Remote Work Zoom Call

Brihaspati had to come back from his vacation. A number of teams were streched thin handling the latest mishap, but instead of the company's stock plummeting, it was 
rising up meteorically. The company also had to revise its own work policy, instead of being able to come in to office, they had to let people work from home and communicate via Zoom
for the first time. 

The call was setup for Brihaspati to learn how the teams were handling the new crisis and working well together. The first speaker was Vayu, he swished open his camera, he looked like he 
was crying, he mentioned that the project they had recently shipped had a bug and now the team doesn't know how to stop the new virus in the air from spreading. 
Ashwini kumar and dhanvantari both looking extremely tired, they co-presented their new vaccine proposal and mentioned Ganesh had given the green light and were 
asking Kubera for equal distribution of the vaccine, however Shani was blocking communities from going for the vaccine. Shiva, kali and Yama who were looking merry
mentioned that their team had already hit their next 5 year goals. Kamadeva was also ecstatic about the results his team was producing, they had the largest growth
rate after years . Indra came in to say for the first time in years, he was not called the most useless god as vayu had taken over the title. 

Playing the devil's advocate, Shukra said this is the risk with global trade.  He asked  which team can cause the next disaster ? Samudra mentioned he
might have something brewing, Kartikeya was unsure about US-China relationship , surya-chandra nodded their heads. 

Indra who recently had a gender reveal party for one of his apsaras, sneezed, causing the wifi to have issues, Brihaspati reminded the team when Ganesha's vehicle 
had wreaked havoc , but they had survived. This pandemic was a blessing and hopefully will give them clues to beat their biggest competitors : Netflix and Candy Crush
