# On House Chores and Projects

Why do people choose to spend time folding their clothes and keeping them pressed in this Remote work enviroment ? Why have so many people moved to gardening and 
other home-improvements projects in the pandemic ? Why do people engage in doing chores and house projects when they can do more stimulating things like playing 
games / watching content on internet ?

 I think there are a few potential reasons
 - Peer and/or Societal Pressure to improve self/home worth
 - Dopamine Hit of doing a chore
 - Time away from the tittilating time on the internet
 - Keeping your brain/body active and learning new things
 - Evolutionary impulses, we have survived by working with plants and keeping enviroment around us clean
 - Finding Structure and Meaning of life in a meaningless existence.

Most of us end up doing chores independent of the reasons. Sometimes you pick the right reasons and sometimes you don't. 
There are two lessons from Atomic Habits that i wanted to talk about here. First is stacking work and the other is definition of self. For e.g. if you like to eat a cookie, 
stack something you want to start doing with something you enjoy , like eating a cookie after you finish work.
For me, its listening to books while doing house chores. Find a way to make the chores rewarding in the beginning. After a few days, these 
activities become so central to your definition of yourself as you do them regularly, you dont need the reward anymore

There is a huge difference between chores and projects. Chores are things you have to do and projects are things you do because you choose to. For e.g choosing
to paint a wall of your house or tightening a loose chair to Stop making the squeaky noise. By thinking and doing projects, you play the long game with your
everyday surroundings , especially in this remote living world , it may be the best thing you can do for yourself !
