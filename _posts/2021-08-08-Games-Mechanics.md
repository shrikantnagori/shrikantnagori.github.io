# Game Mechanics

Like others around me, I am bullish on gaming. I spend many many hours playing games. From actual physical games to board games. From cards to table top games. From 
playing offline to online. From steam to Xbox. What I've found that makes a game for me are its mechanics. The many interesting mechanics are

- **Drafting** :
             This is similar to team selection, who goes first. You pick the players you want, knowing the pool of players. It
             requires knowing in depth about the game. Knowing who beats what, which combination works best , what new changes has happened that might affect
             past comparisons. 

- **Playing the probabilities** : In any luck based game, the key is ot know the probability of your move. This of-course requires counting/noting what
                              others are doing.  Poker is the easiest example, but this applies to most card based games where knowing how many cards of a type are
                              available vs how many cards are gone helps define the strategies up in play


- **Mastering the combos** : Most video games work a simple principle , we will introduce new abilities, but in order for you to do them, you need to master the       previous move,
                  jump, run, pick, throw and change view actions. If you can do that, it's just about navigating the new ability on top of these basic moves. 
                  Mastering these come from repeat playing and practicing combos. Most games fall in this category, but the key is to continue to master new 
                  combos. This is true in most physical games as you train your body, but also true is most games like deck/engine building, Fifa, mario and even card trick games.
                  

- **Playing the opponent** : This is the part of the game where winning or losing is decided. Even if you have been playing probabilities, each opponent shows some 
                          weakness , stopping them is what will enable the win. You may not have mastered the combos to be able to take advantage of the weakness yet,
                          but finding the weakness and reducing their probabilities is still the big way games are won and lost.
                          
 
One of the best part of these mechanics is that these are so universal, that they apply to even trivia. The key in game playing is to spend the most time mastering
the combos, which is where the most fun comes from. The rest are for merely winning or having a easy game :)
