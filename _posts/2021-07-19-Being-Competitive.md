# Being competitive

As the famous dialogue in the 3 idiots movie goes, " Life is a race ", being competitive comes naturally to us. Evolution has told us, its the survival of the fittest. 

From the youngest ages, where scoring good marks didn't matter if you didnt score the highest to adulthood where relative grading in college and relative ranking 
in workplace has become a cornerstone in how we operate.
One's sense of self is determined not by how they are measuring up against their old version, but by how much progress others have made.

Being competiive has high returns , it allows you to have benchmarks that you thought were not possible. 
Being competitive keeps us motivated, just to keep yourself in the race against others, you have to show up.
Being competitive is about respect, seeing someone defeat their demons helps you defeat yours. 
Being competitive helps others, like friendship, competition is a two way street. So being competitive helps others as much as it helps you.

So continue being competitive. Fighting for things, involving others in your struggles, because the sure shot way of improving is to see others do it.
