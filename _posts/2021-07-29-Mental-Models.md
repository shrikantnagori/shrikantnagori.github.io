# Mental models

Systems are complex,  systems are constantly evolving and systems fail. Whether its a project that you work on or the food you cook, 
whether its our power grid or the animal ecosystem, whether its the economy or a family relationship, they all have layers and layers , dependencies, 
assumptions and sometimes sheer luck that's making it work. 

The key idea  for building , maintaining and learning about complex systems is to have a shared mental model and goals. If only you know how the dishwasher 
works in a specific configuration, the day you are not around, dishes wont be done. If your spouse doesn't know why the vacation to Hawaii means so much to you,
they'll not show enough excitement. If your colleagues don't know, why a certain dependency is critical, they may remove it and all hell will break lose. The key to 
have systems continue running is to have a shared mental model. 


Shared mental models help build shared goals. If you envision the major problems in economy are due to a certain party's philosophy, if the idea is shared by a 
number of people in the country, the party will not get into power again. If you share a registry of gifts for a new baby, people will buy them for you. They look 
forward to seeing the baby use those products when they come meet them. 

The last point is about how to build shared mental models. Writing is definitely one of the best ways of doing it. One other way I believe that works is to listen to 
others, the more you hear , the more you understand others mental models which is as important as telling others about your mental models. Sharing your story 
becomes much easier if you have listened and incorporated their ideas in yours.
