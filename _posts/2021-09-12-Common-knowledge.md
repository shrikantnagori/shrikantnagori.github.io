# Common knowledge 

I really like [Netflix's Explained](https://www.netflix.com/title/80216752) for the solo purpose that it makes important topics for humanity , common knowledge.
What is common knowledge ? Its as the name sounds, something that majority of the human beings have similar responses to. Simple examples include
climate change is happening more rapidly, sugar and social media is bad, but there are alternatives , skin-care is made more complicated due to advertisement 
industry and higher level of pollutions.

Making complex topics common knowledge has a lot of value. The main reason for tv shows, movies , sports being the most common conversation topics is that most humans
have a common base knowledge about these topics, its super likely you meet a random stranger and they are aware of the characters of your watched tv-show , 
so you can find out about other similar content, without having to build common base first. By making these complex but critical topics common knowledge,
it allows the world to have more useful discussion about some of these interesting topics rather than , how's the weather ? It allows individuals to follow the right 
ideals instead of the purposefully complex ones benefiting capitalistic socities.

I am definitely extrapolating the impact of the show for a point, its obvious, explained for all of its goodness, is not as popular or followed as say 
John Oliver's Last Week Tonight, rarely few people go on netflix for learning, youtube is a much more preferred medium . As we end up becoming a more and more
creator economy, ideas from shows like explained will be packaged and re-purposed by creators and their followers will ideally end up getting the content in one way
or other. A food creator will make  different kinds of [sugar](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/460ndj/why_are_sugar_substitutes_supposed_to_be_bad_for/d01kvc5/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) common knowledge, 
a beauty creator will talk make skin complexity common knowledge , an environmentalist about hurricanes and reach millions of more followers via other mediums like tiktok, youtube, snapchat with even smaller
video sizes. 

As these stories gets retold from different perspectives and on different mediums. Hopefully, common knowledge doesn't get lost in translation, but
rather gets embellished with even more lived in experiences by the creators.
